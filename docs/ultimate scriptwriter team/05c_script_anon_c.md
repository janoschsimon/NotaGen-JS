TITLE: DER LETZTE FIZZ

===

INT. PYROTECHNIK-LAGER - TAG

Rows of gleaming fireworks tower over FIZZ, a small firecracker with a visible scratch across his casing. He's wedged between SUPERNOVA-12 rockets — sleek, perfect, massive.

SUPERNOVA #1
(booming voice)
Tonight's the night, baby! Gonna light up the whole sky!

SUPERNOVA #2
I'm programmed for EIGHT color bursts. Eight!

Fizz looks down at his own small body. His fuse trembles slightly.

FIZZ
(whispering to himself)
I can shine too. I just... need my chance.

A HAND reaches into the bin. Fizz perks up. The hand grabs BOTH Supernovas.

Fizz deflates.

Then — a CHILD'S HAND appears. Small fingers. They hover over the expensive rockets... then land on Fizz.

KID (O.S.)
This one's cute. And only twenty cents!

Fizz's scratch catches the light as he's lifted up.

FIZZ
(breathless)
Yes. Yes! This is it!

EXT. GARTEN - SILVESTER-NACHT

Families cluster around tables. The sky already sparkles with distant explosions. The Kid carries Fizz to a launching area where the two Supernovas are already set up.

SUPERNOVA #1
(spotting Fizz)
Oh look, the clearance-bin reject made it.

The Kid's VATER lights Supernova #1. It SCREAMS into the sky — BOOM! — a cascade of gold and silver.

The crowd GASPS. CHEERS.

Supernova #2 launches — BOOM! — eight perfect color bursts, exactly as promised.

MORE CHEERS.

Fizz is placed in position. The Vater checks his watch.

VATER
Zehn Sekunden bis Mitternacht!

The Kid lights Fizz's fuse. It SIZZLES.

Fizz closes his eyes.

FIZZ
(to himself)
Please. Please let me shine.

The fuse burns down. The crowd counts down.

CROWD
DREI... ZWEI... EINS... FROHES NEUES JAHR!

Fizz's core ignites.

No explosion.

No scream.

Just... a soft, warm RED GLOW. Like embers. Like a heartbeat made of light.

The crowd falls silent. The Vater frowns.

VATER
Das war's? Defekt...

But the Kid KNEELS beside Fizz, eyes wide. The glow pulses gently. It doesn't hurt to look at. It draws you in.

KID
(whispering)
Schön...

Fizz feels the warmth inside him. This isn't what he wanted. But it's what he IS.

FIZZ
(barely audible)
I'm... not broken. I'm just... different.

The glow continues. Steady. Calming. Like a tiny lighthouse.

EXT. GARTEN - DUNKLE ECKE - LATER

The party has moved inside. Spent fireworks litter the grass. Fizz lies in the dirt, his glow reduced to a faint ember.

FOOTSTEPS — small, stumbling.

A LITTLE GIRL (6) appears from the darkness between trees, tears on her cheeks. She's lost. The garden is too big, too dark, too confusing after all the noise.

She spots Fizz's faint red glow.

She moves toward it.

One step. Then another.

Fizz feels her presence. His ember BRIGHTENS — just a little. Just enough.

The girl follows the glow. It leads her around a hedge, past the tool shed, back toward—

EXT. GARTEN - TERRASSE

The girl's MUTTER turns, sees her daughter emerge from the dark.

MUTTER
(rushing over)
Da bist du ja! Ich hab dich gesucht!

The girl hugs her mother, then looks back toward the dark corner where Fizz glows.

GIRL
(pointing)
Das kleine Licht hat mir geholfen.

In the dirt, Fizz's glow fades completely. His job is done.

But for the first time, he doesn't feel small.

FIZZ (V.O.)
I wasn't made to explode.
I was made to guide.

The last ember dies.

In the distance, a NEW firework screams into the sky — BOOM! — brilliant and blinding.

But down here, in the quiet dark, Fizz found his light.

FADE OUT.

THE END
